4. Fairness through regularization (in-processing)
    4.1. Balanced Neighborhood SLIM
    (provider and consumer fairness)
    note: the limitations, not dynamic, transparent, .. so... reranking
    
5. Fairness through post-processing
    5.1 A survey of re-rankers ( adding some overall experiments to compare methods)
    5.2 FAR/PFAR
    5.3 OFAIR
    5.4 SCRUF
    (provider fairness)

6. Standardizing & automating Fairness related experiments
    6.1 RecSys experimentation platforms
    6.2 librec-auto

7. Conclusion & future work
    7.1 Transparency
    7.2 Data minimization
