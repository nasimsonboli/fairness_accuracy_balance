% \section{Transparency}
% \section{Data minimization}

a brief discussion of the issues of accuracy

solutions presented

then the limitations

group fairness we try to provide solutions for

bias isn't felt equally by everyone
societal harms

don't lose the protected value concept when writing about popularity bias

popularity bias plays into it, but it's not only that.. these put a bigger burden on the protective group
example, black women who sing in Spanish are treated unfairly

I am not trying to solve the whole issue. I am creating tools and examples of the technology so researchers can use and apply in their own applications

it is not perfect set of solutions they are just examples of how to approach this problem and providing tools to help mitigating the issue

this work is not also a rich detailed analysis of Kiva
