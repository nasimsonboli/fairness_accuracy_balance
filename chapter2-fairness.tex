% There has been considerable research in the area of diversity-aware recommendation~\cite{Vargas:2011:RRN:2043932.2043955,adomavicius2012improving} where these systems treat recommendation as a multi-objective optimization problem where the goal is to maintain a certain level of accuracy, while also ensuring that recommendation lists are diverse with respect to some representation of item content. These techniques can be re-purposed for P-fairness recommendation by treating the items from the protected group as a different class and then optimizing for diverse recommendations relative to this definition.
